I am a postdoctoral researcher in Yale's Applied Mathematics department, working with professors Raphy Coifman and Anna Gilbert. Our research centers on developing innovative wavelet methods to uncover hidden structures in data matrices, with wide-ranging applications in data analysis.

I have a background in physical chemistry, after completing my Ph.D. in the Computational Soft Matter group at Yale's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, advised by professors Amir Haji-Akbari and Raphy Coifman. My doctoral research focused on developing numerical methods for analyzing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. I explored critical computational challenges, including quantifying finite-size effects, and investigating interfacial effects on the dynamics of liquids, both in the case of estimating transport coefficients and heterogeneous nucleation rates in the presence of supercooling.

My research interests are broadly in statistical physics and applied mathematics. I am very interested in leveraging advanced computational methods, such as those arising in the machine learning community, to solve complex scientific problems, particularly those arising from physical chemistry.
